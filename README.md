**Ansible Interview Question**
1. How do you manage secrets and sensitive data in Ansible?
   
I use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and certificates. I create encrypted files using ansible-vault create or ansible-vault encrypt, and reference them in my playbooks. For CI/CD pipelines, I either store the vault password securely or inject it via environment variables.

2. Difference between roles and tasks?
   
Tasks are individual units of work in a playbook. Roles are a higher-level abstraction that group tasks, handlers, templates, files, and variables in a standardized structure. I use roles when I need reusability, modularity, and better organization in large-scale playbooks.
________________________________________
3. Difference between when and handlers?
   
when is used to run tasks conditionally. handlers are triggered only when notified (e.g., when a config file changes).
Example use case: A template task updates an nginx config, and when it does, it notifies a handler to restart nginx‚Äîbut only if the file actually changed.
________________________________________
4. How do you test playbooks before production?
   
I use Ansible dry-run mode with --check, and often use Molecule for testing roles. I test in a staging environment that mirrors production, and sometimes use Docker containers for quick testing with Molecule and Testinfra.
________________________________________
5. Have you used dynamic inventory?
   
Yes. I‚Äôve used AWS dynamic inventory using aws_ec2 plugin to fetch instances based on tags. It‚Äôs very useful in cloud environments where servers are dynamic. I configure ansible.cfg to use the dynamic script or plugin.
________________________________________
6. Managing playbooks across environments (dev/test/prod)?
   
I use group_vars and host_vars directories. Each environment has its own inventory file and set of variables. Sometimes, I use --extra-vars or environment-specific YAML files loaded with vars_files.
________________________________________
7. Handle OS-specific tasks in a single playbook?
   
I use when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian' or when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS' to branch logic within the playbook. This way, I can maintain a single playbook that works across different OS families.
________________________________________
8. Integration with CI/CD tools?
   
Yes. I‚Äôve integrated Ansible with Jenkins and GitLab CI. I write Ansible tasks in pipeline jobs to deploy code, configure servers, and do environment checks. Vault credentials are injected using Jenkins credentials plugin or GitLab secrets.
________________________________________
9. Difference between include and import?
    
import_tasks is static ‚Äî it‚Äôs processed at playbook parsing time. include_tasks is dynamic ‚Äî processed during execution.
Use include_tasks when you want to include conditionally (e.g., inside a loop or under a when).
________________________________________
10. How do you optimize playbook execution time?
I use:
‚Ä¢	serial to parallelize tasks in batches.
‚Ä¢	delegate_to for centralized tasks (like notifying load balancers).
‚Ä¢	async and poll for background tasks.
‚Ä¢	fact_caching to avoid collecting facts repeatedly.

üîç Scenario-Based Ansible Interview Questions
üîπ Scenario 1: Application Deployment
"You're tasked with deploying a Java application across 100 servers, some are CentOS and others are Ubuntu. You need to ensure dependencies are installed correctly based on OS, configuration files are templated, and services restarted on changes. How would you structure your Ansible project?"

‚úÖ What they‚Äôre looking for:

Use of roles, vars, templates, handlers

ansible_os_family usage

block, when, and notify conditions

üîπ Scenario 2: Zero-Downtime Deployment
"You have a web application hosted on 10 nodes behind a load balancer. How would you update the application with Ansible without causing downtime?"

‚úÖ Expected concepts:

Rolling update using serial

pre_tasks and post_tasks

Using delegate_to for LB health checks

wait_for module

üîπ Scenario 3: Secure Credential Management
"You need to deploy a playbook that uses DB credentials and API tokens. They should not be exposed in Git. How do you manage this securely in your Ansible workflow?"

‚úÖ Expected topics:

ansible-vault encrypt_string / encrypted files

Vault password files / CI Vault integration

Use of environment variables (fallback)

üîπ Scenario 4: Multi-Environment Support
"You maintain different environments (dev, qa, prod) that need slightly different configs. How would you write a reusable playbook that can be applied across all without duplicating code?"

‚úÖ Expected structure:

group_vars/env/

host_vars/ overrides

Use of --extra-vars or ansible_env

üîπ Scenario 5: Failure Handling
"One of your tasks fails on 2 out of 50 servers due to a transient network issue. How do you make sure the playbook doesn't stop and can retry failed hosts later?"

‚úÖ Concepts:

max_fail_percentage

ignore_errors

retry_files

serial execution strategy

Answers
**Scenario 1: Java App Deployment Across Mixed OS Servers**

I‚Äôd create a role named java_app_deploy. Inside it:
Use when to handle apt for Ubuntu and yum for CentOS in tasks/install_dependencies.yml.
Use templates/ for config files with variables from group_vars/.
handlers/main.yml for restarting the app if config changes.
Inventory would have groups like [ubuntu_nodes] and [centos_nodes].

**Scenario 2: Zero-Downtime Deployment**

I'd use:
serial: 2 to deploy in small batches.
pre_tasks to remove the node from LB.
Deploy app using block.
post_tasks to add the node back to LB after a health check (uri or wait_for).
delegate_to for managing load balancer actions.

**Scenario 3: Managing Credentials Securely**
I encrypt secrets with ansible-vault. For example:
bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'MySecret123' --name 'db_password'
In CI, I decrypt using --vault-password-file or pass the password using ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE. I never commit raw passwords.

**Scenario 4: Reusable Multi-Environment Playbook**

I structure directories like this:
markdown
Copy
Edit
inventories/
  dev/
    hosts
    group_vars/
  prod/
    hosts
    group_vars/
My playbook refers to vars_files based on inventory. I run with:
bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventories/prod/hosts

**Scenario 5: Handling Failures Gracefully**
I use:

max_fail_percentage: 10 to allow some hosts to fail without breaking the entire run.
ignore_errors: yes if the task isn't critical.
I enable --retry so I can rerun only failed hosts using site.retry.
Use serial and until with retries for unstable networks.
